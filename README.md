# Toolshed App - Project 3
 App where user can organize their tools like a virtual garage. Future Development: This virtual garage could expand to any theme the user chooses from a list of themes that have been created. Meaning that the objects stored in the virtual garage DONT even have to be “tools”

Database is “mainly” divided into 3 groups:

1) Tools you have: This inventory of the tools they own will help with the uses of Databases 2 and 3.This will be a visual representation and an organizer to let the user(and us!)  know what to add or complete their toolset.
2) Tools you want: a connection or api would be combined with this database to get ad revenue or sponsorship. sers can shop for tools they want by requesting it on the app. 
3) Tools that you lent your friends(to whom and where): This way you will not be searching for hours for a tool you do not have! Future Dev: The user would ask the borrower to also download the app, there would be a secure connection between both apps, and the borrower could verify and confirm that he/she borrowed said tool. There could also be a limit of time and usage to said tool that is agreed upon during this step.
